            <li>Comuters are very literal and stubid, they do exactly what you tell them and nothing else, and then do not save history, we have to tell programs to store data.
                We have to tell the computer exactly what infromation to hold, where, and for how long. It is also crucial we understand where it is stored so we can easily access
                it later. 
            </li>
            <li>Dont Forget to update Page Titles! You can NOT do h1.5 or h5+ </li>
            <li>Our Job is to make the user expirence better and easier! People should be able to navigate a webage with no deep thought of how to find what they need. It should be 
                clear, easy to read, and understandable at a glance.
