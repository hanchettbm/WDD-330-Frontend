                Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure all required form controls are filled out, in the correct format. This is called client-side 
                form validation, and helps ensure data submitted matches the requirements set forth in the various form controls. This is why the required tag on an input form 
                is so crucial. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Client-side validation should not be considered an exhaustive security measure!! You should always have more then one type of error checking. For client side validation 
                you can check if the form input is the right format (Pasword, email must contain '@' etc.) or make it required meaning the user can not leave it blank. These are specifially 
                for forms. If the information is correctly formatted, the application allows the data to be submitted to the server and (usually) saved in a database; if the information isn't 
                correctly formatted, it gives the user an error message explaining what needs to be corrected, and lets them try again. This is built in. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Although we want to make filling forms as easy as possible we also have to make sure we are getting the right data, otherwise it's pointless. 
                JavaScript also has customizable validation. HTML built in validation includes: required, minlength, maxlength, pattern, invalid, etc. 
            </li>


            <li>
                The Navigator object contains information about the browser being used (This can be faked so use the URL more). The window.location property is 
                an object that contains information about the URL of the current page.The protocol property returns a string describing the protocol used (such as http, https).
                You can also access host, hostname, port, pathname, and search as well as origin. The window.history property can be used to access information about any previously 
                visited pages in the current browser session. (Avoid confusing this with the new HTML5 History API) The window.history.length property shows how many pages have been 
                visited before arriving at the current page. The window.history.go() method can be used to go to a specific page, where 0 is the current page:                
            </li>

            <li>
                A new window can be opened using the window.open(). Close with the close() method. The window.screen object contains information about the screen the browser is displayed 
                on (height, with etc.) You can also use Document.Wrtie(). Cookies are created in the Document window. You can also set timed interval functions. You can use timing to create
                animations on the page. *In general, it is typically better to use CSS for any animation effects, although there may be times when JavaScript might be the better solution.
            </li>

            <li>
                The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser.The HTML5 specification contains a number of APIs that 
                help to gain access to hardware, such as cameras, batteries, geolocation, and the graphics card. If a browser supports the Web Storage API, the window object will have a 
                property called localStorage, which is a native object with a number of properties and methods used to store data. There are also geolocation functions.
                The canvas element was introduced to allow graphics to be drawn onto a web page in real time using JavaScript.
                The terms shim and polyfill are often used interchangeably. The main difference between them is that a shim is a piece of code that adds some missing functionality to a 
                browser, although the implementation method may differ slightly from the standard API. A polyfill is a shim that achieves the same functionality, while also using the API
                commands that would be used if the feature was supported natively.

        <h2>Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>How is accsessing the browser window data different from accessing the session data, or are they linked?</li>
                <li>How do you keep up on API updates?</li>
                <li>Are the laws and limits to cookie and browsing data? What can we not track?</li>
                <li>Is it better to work with native or server information instead of the browser?</li>
