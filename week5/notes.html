               Errors are usually caused by: System error (thereâ€™s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.) 
               Programmer error (the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo.)
               User error (the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.) An exception is an error that produces a 
               return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Stack traces show exactly when and where the error occured which allows the user to better understand what is happening and debug. 
            </li>

            <li>
                A warning is an error that is small enough to NOT crash but should still be fixed. ECMAScript 5 introduced a strict mode that produces
                 more exceptions and warnings and prohibits the use of some deprecated features. Using this version will help to catch errors earrly on.
                 In addition to using javascript built in error checking it is crucial that the programmer also does their own. (Mostly making sure that the 
                 variable actually contains what we think it should in all different cases). It is also important to warn the programmer and user with an output 
                 that we can understand. Alerts in the browser are great for this. We can also use the console to debug, Console.log is a great way to see what 
                 is happening at different times in the code. 
            </li>


            <li>
                Browsers also have debugging tools. Use the "debugger" keyword. (Make sure you remove this from the final version!!!!!!!!!!).
                Error objects also help, are are usually paired with a try, catch statmenent. These exceptions are thrown. 
                It is also useful to run test cases to see if the output is what we expect in different scenarios. It's useful to write code to pass 
                our tests. the "jest" library helps with this. There are also lots of functions that test equality. Make sure that the results are not only 
                just producing output but a realistic one.

        <h2>Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>We use typescript at work and it is basically javascript with more error checking, will we ever use this in classes?</li>
                <li>How can you catch errors simply due to spelling?</li>
                <li>Are there places on campus that let us code review with others?</li>
                <li>How do you come up with test cases?</li>
