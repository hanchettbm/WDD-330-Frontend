        <h2>Week 02 notes and reading</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Comments are extremely important to help others be able to read your code, as well as yourself to be able to reread your own. Remeber to do this for the next team activity.
            </li>
            <li>Javascript is a C-Style language because it's written like C. Even though semicolons are not needed use them! You will avoid sooooo many errors. 
            </li>
            <li>There are reserved words in JS (like other languaged) that can NOT be used for variables or functions because they already have specific uses. They are:
                <ul>
                <li>"abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const, continue, debugger, default, delete, do, double, else, enum, export, extends, false, final, finally, 
                    float, for, function, goto, if, implements, import, in instanceof, int, interface, let, long, native, new, null, package, private, protected, public, return, short, static, 
                    super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, throws, transient, true, try, typeof, var, volatile, void, while, with, yield"</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                JavaScript has a special operator called "typeof()" for finding out the type of a value. You do Not need to set type when defining a variable. You can enter a variable name into 
                the console to see its value. (console.log() also works for this.) Also "var" is old. Use "let" instead.
            </li>
            <li>
                Constant and variable names can start with any upper or lower-case letter, an underscore, _, or dollar character, $. They can also contain numbers, but cannot start with them.
                The backslash is used to escape special characters in strings such as: 
                <li>Single quote marks \', Double quote marks \", End of line \n, Carriage return \r, Tab \t.</li>
            </li>
            <li>
                Symbols can be used to create unique values, which helps to avoid any naming collisions. "Use Symbol()". You can also convert Numbers to strings.
                Bitwise operators work with operands that are 32-bit integers. These are numbers written in binary (base two) that have 32 digits made up of just 0 s and 1 s.
            </li>
            <li>
                Comparisons work exactly the same as C. Except that NaN is the only value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself! 
            </li>
            <li>
                Delete values from arrays using "delete". There is also a reverse function! Numbers get sorted alphabeltially
            </li>
            <li>The callback is provided as a parameter, then invoked inside the body of the function.
                <p>
                    function sing(song,callback) { <br>
                        console.log(`I'm singing along to ${song}.`); <br>
                        callback(); <br>
                    }<br>
                <P>
            </li>
            <li>
                Keep Code DRY! "Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself"
            </li>
        <ul>
